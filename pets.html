    <p class="apollo"> This is my giant 9 month old puppy. His name is Apollo. We got him when he was around 3 months
        old. He is quite the character. If you aren't paying attention to him then there's a loud sigh. When he sleeps
        he sounds like a bear snoring. Sometimes you have to put headphones in. But overall he's a very living and
        caring dog. He loves his cuddle time and is usually sleeping by your feet.</p>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_Mountain_Dog" class="gpd"> Great Pyrenees</a> Mix. Apollo is
        predicted to be between 120 to 140 pounds by time he is done growing. Fun Fact! Because the two dog breeds are
        giant breed dogs, he won't be done growing until around 13 months of age. My giant puppy is currently 90 pounds
        with 4 more months of growing!
